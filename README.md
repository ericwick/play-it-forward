Play It Forward is charitable recreational sports league organizer for adults and children. 

The inspiration for the development of this application is the universal desire to become the best verison of yourself through athletic engagement. Built around the concept of community-based organizing, the idea is to work toward a nation where kids of any age are able to participate in any sport they want regardless of their socioeconomic status. 

The registration contributions from the adult leagues help make the kids' leagues possible, but any additional efforts via donations would help the leagues thrive and provide an exceptional experience for the children. 

The end result would afford everyone who is wanting to Play the opportunity to Play!
