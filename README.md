Play It Forward is charitable recreational sports league organizer for adults and children. 

The inspiration for the development of this application is the universal desire to become the best verison of yourself through athletic engagement. Built around the concept of community-based organizing, the idea is to work toward a nation where kids of any age are able to participate in any sport they want regardless of their socioeconomic status. 

The registration contributions from the adult leagues help make the kids' leagues possible, but any additional efforts via donations would help the leagues thrive and provide an exceptional experience for the children. 

The end result would afford everyone who is wanting to Play the opportunity to Play!

Upon reaching the site, users are directed to first create a username and password through the Login button and from there new users will be routed directly to the registration form to complete the sign-up process. On the Registration page, the inputs are built to give the users available leagues and teams based on their age, gender, location, and sport preference.

The application uses Auth0 to verify users' identify in the login process. (shown below)

The user is brought to their profile page upon logging in and on that page they have the ability to change their profile picture and cover photo and write an "About Me" blurb about themselves. They also have links to their team and league pages. On the team page (shown below), the first section is a live-update of the total team donations. Teammates can also view their roster and individual stats located on player cards and each team page also features a chat.
